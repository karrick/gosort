# gosort

sorting algorithms expressed in Go

## Observations

At 10 integers, insertion sort (1) is most efficient.

At 50 integers, insertion sort (2) is most efficient.

At 100 integers, insertion sort (3) is most efficient.

At about 5k integers, heap sort becomes faster than insertion sort
(3).
